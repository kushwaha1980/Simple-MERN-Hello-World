## Getting Started 

Note: The backend requires a running MongoDB instance (you can sign up for a free trial of [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas) if needed)

1. Clone this repository

2. Go to the Backend folder and run:

```bash
$ export MONGO_URI="mongodb+srv://user:password@address"
$ node server.js
```

3. Go to the root of the application folder, install the required dependencies and run:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

4. You should then see the output on your local http://localhost:3001/
